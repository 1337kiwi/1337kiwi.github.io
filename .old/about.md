Hi there ü•ù I'm Kiwi!

I have fun breaking things and making them work in different ways. 

I'm an AI Red Teamer at an AI company in North Carolina. 

You'll notice that beyond this, there isn't much else about me on this site. I give this site out to everyone, so I try to make it somewhat non-trivial for bad faith actors to act in bad faith. If you cared enough, you'll find out who I am anyways though. Good luck! 



In my free time, I enjoy:
- Playing PC Games. Current favourite game is [A Story About My Uncle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/278360/).
- Taking care of [Zuko](assets/images/zuko2.png).
- Tearing myself apart to be a better person.
- Coaching those around me to be the person they wish to be.
- Organizing security conferences (DEF CON Goon, BSIDES RDU, CackalackyCon, ShmooCon).
- Bouldering.
- Making friends with strangers.


You matter, stranger. Let me know how I can help.
